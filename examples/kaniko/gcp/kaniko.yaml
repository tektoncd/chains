  description: >-
    This Task builds a simple Dockerfile with kaniko and pushes to a registry.
    This Task stores the image name and digest as results, allowing Tekton Chains to pick up
    that an image was built & sign it.
    This task is designed to work with GCP, and push to a GCR registry.
  params:
  - name: IMAGE
    description: Name (reference) of the image to build.
  - name: DOCKERFILE
    description: Path to the Dockerfile to build.
    default: ./Dockerfile
  - name: CONTEXT
    description: The build context used by Kaniko.
    default: ./
  - name: EXTRA_ARGS
    default: ""
  - name: CREDENTIALS_FILE
    default: "credentials.json"
  - name: BUILDER_IMAGE
